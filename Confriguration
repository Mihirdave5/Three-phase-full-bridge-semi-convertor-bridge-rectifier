configuring three phase input:
source 1:
Peak amplitude:415VAC.
Phase Deg:0
Frequency:50Hz
source 2:
Peak amplitude:415VAC.
Phase Deg:-120
Frequency:50Hz
source 3:
Peak amplitude:415VAC.
Phase Deg:+120
Frequency:50Hz
Total frequency of three pase input supply is 360(Deg) and each phase has 120(Deg) phase shifted from each other.
Configuring Pulse generator:
P.generator 1:
period:0.020(20ms)
Phase Delay:0.0015(1.5ms)
P.generator 2:
period:0.020(20ms)
Phase Delay:0.0075(7.5ms)
P.generator 3:
period:0.020(20ms)
Phase Delay:0.015(15ms)
Pulse Generators are used to triger gate of SCR.
